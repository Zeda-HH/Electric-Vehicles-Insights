# Electric-Vehicles-Analysis

## Project Overview 

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing the automotive industry, contributing to sustainable transportation and reducing carbon emissions. This project explores an EV dataset using SQL to uncover key insights into market trends, vehicle performance, and consumer preferences.

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze the dataset to derive actionable insights.
Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Answer key questions about the electric vehicle market, such as performance metrics, pricing trends, and popular brands.
This repository serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating SQL data analysis skills, data cleaning, and querying techniques.

### Dataset

Source: The dataset contains information about various electric vehicle models, including specifications such as range, price, brand, battery capacity, charging speed, and release year.

Fields in the Dataset:

- Brand: The manufacturer of the electric vehicle.
- Model: The specific model name of the EV.
- Range (km): Maximum distance the EV can travel on a full charge.
- Battery Capacity (kWh): The energy storage capacity of the battery.
- Charging Speed (kW): The rate at which the EV charges.
- Price (USD): Cost of the vehicle.
- Release Year: The year the vehicle model was released.

### Key Queries

#### Data Cleaning:
- Handling missing or null values.
- Cleaning column values for consistency.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
